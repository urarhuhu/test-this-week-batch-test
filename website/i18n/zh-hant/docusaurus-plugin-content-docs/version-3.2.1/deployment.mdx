description: Deploy your Docusaurus app for production on a range of static site hosting services.

# Deployment

To build the static files of your website for production, run:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run build
```

Once it finishes, the static files will be generated within the `build` directory.

:::note

The only responsibility of Docusaurus is to build your site and emit static files in `build`.

It is now up to you to choose how to host those static files.

:::

You can deploy your site to static site hosting services such as [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Render](https://render.com/docs/static-sites), and [Surge](https://surge.sh/help/getting-started-with-surge).

A Docusaurus site is statically rendered, and it can generally work without JavaScript!

## Configuration {#configuration}

The following parameters are required in `docusaurus.config.js` to optimize routing and serve files from the correct location:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `url` | URL for your site. For a site deployed at `https://my-org.com/my-project/`, `url` is `https://my-org.com/`. |
| `baseUrl` | Base URL for your project, with a trailing slash. For a site deployed at `https://my-org.com/my-project/`, `baseUrl` is `/my-project/`. |

## Testing your Build Locally {#testing-build-locally}

It is important to test your build locally before deploying it for production. Docusaurus provides a [`docusaurus serve`](cli.mdx#docusaurus-serve-sitedir) command for that:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run serve
```

By default, this will load your site at [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/).

## Trailing slash configuration {#trailing-slashes}

Docusaurus has a [`trailingSlash` config](./api/docusaurus.config.js.mdx#trailingSlash) to allow customizing URLs/links and emitted filename patterns.

The default value generally works fine. Unfortunately, each static hosting provider has a **different behavior**, and deploying the exact same site to various hosts can lead to distinct results. Depending on your host, it can be useful to change this config.

:::tip

Use [slorber/trailing-slash-guide](https://github.com/slorber/trailing-slash-guide) to understand better the behavior of your host and configure `trailingSlash` appropriately.

:::

## Using environment variables {#using-environment-variables}

Putting potentially sensitive information in the environment is common practice. However, in a typical Docusaurus website, the `docusaurus.config.js` file is the only interface to the Node.js environment (see [our architecture overview](advanced/architecture.mdx)), while everything else (MDX pages, React components, etc.) are client side and do not have direct access to the `process` global variable. In this case, you can consider using [`customFields`](api/docusaurus.config.js.mdx#customFields) to pass environment variables to the client side.

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
// If you are using dotenv (https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
import 'dotenv/config';

export default {
  title: '...',
  url: process.env.URL, // You can use environment variables to control site specifics as well
  // highlight-start
  customFields: {
    // Put your custom environment here
    teamEmail: process.env.EMAIL,
  },
  // highlight-end
};
```

```jsx title="home.jsx"
import useDocusaurusContext from '@docusaurus/useDocusaurusContext';

export default function Home() {
  const {
    siteConfig: {customFields},
  } = useDocusaurusContext();
  return <div>Contact us through {customFields.teamEmail}!</div>;
}
```

## Choosing a hosting provider {#choosing-a-hosting-provider}

There are a few common hosting options:

- [Self hosting](#self-hosting) with an HTTP server like Apache2 or Nginx.
- Jamstack providers (e.g. [Netlify](#deploying-to-netlify) and [Vercel](#deploying-to-vercel)). We will use them as references, but the same reasoning can apply to other providers.
- [GitHub Pages](#deploying-to-github-pages) (by definition, it is also Jamstack, but we compare it separately).

If you are unsure of which one to choose, ask the following questions:

<details>

<summary>
  How many resources (money, person-hours, etc.) am I willing to invest in this?
</summary>

- 🔴 Self-hosting requires experience in networking as well as Linux and web server administration. It's the most difficult option, and would require the most time to manage successfully. Expense-wise, cloud services are almost never free, and purchasing/deploying an onsite server can be even more costly.
- 🟢 Jamstack providers can help you set up a working website in almost no time and offer features like server-side redirects that are easily configurable. Many providers offer generous build-time quotas even for free plans that you would almost never exceed. However, free plans have limits, and you would need to pay once you hit those limits. Check the pricing page of your provider for details.
- 🟡 The GitHub Pages deployment workflow can be tedious to set up. (Evidence: see the length of [Deploying to GitHub Pages](#deploying-to-github-pages)!) However, this service (including build and deployment) is always free for public repositories, and we have detailed instructions to help you make it work.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How much server-side customization do I need?</summary>

- 🟢 With self-hosting, you have access to the entire server's configuration. You can configure the virtual host to serve different content based on the request URL, you can do complicated server-side redirects, you can implement authentication, and so on. If you need a lot of server-side features, self-host your website.
- 🟡 Jamstack usually offers some server-side configuration (e.g. URL formatting (trailing slashes), server-side redirects, etc.).
- 🔴 GitHub Pages doesn't expose server-side configuration besides enforcing HTTPS and setting CNAME records.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do I need collaboration-friendly deployment workflows?</summary>

- 🟡 Self-hosted services can leverage continuous deployment functionality like Netlify, but more heavy-lifting is involved. Usually, you would designate a specific person to manage the deployment, and the workflow wouldn't be very git-based as opposed to the other two options.
- 🟢 Netlify and Vercel have deploy previews for every pull request, which is useful for a team to review work before merging to production. You can also manage a team with different member access to the deployment.
- 🟡 GitHub Pages cannot do deploy previews in a non-convoluted way. One repo can only be associated with one site deployment. On the other hand, you can control who has write access to the site's deployment.

</details>

There isn't a silver bullet. You need to weigh your needs and resources before making a choice.

## Self-Hosting {#self-hosting}

Docusaurus can be self-hosted using [`docusaurus serve`](cli.mdx#docusaurus-serve-sitedir). Change port using `--port` and `--host` to change host.

```bash npm2yarn
npm run serve -- --build --port 80 --host 0.0.0.0
```

:::warning

It is not the best option, compared to a static hosting provider / CDN.

:::

:::warning

In the following sections, we will introduce a few common hosting providers and how they should be configured to deploy Docusaurus sites most efficiently. Docusaurus is not affiliated with any of these services, and this information is provided for convenience only. Some of the write-ups are provided by third-parties, and recent API changes may not be reflected on our side. If you see outdated content, PRs are welcome.

Because we can only provide this content on a best-effort basis only, we have stopped accepting PRs adding new hosting options. You can, however, publish your writeup on a separate site (e.g. your blog, or the provider's official website), and ask us to include a link to your writeup.

:::

## Deploying to Netlify {#deploying-to-netlify}

To deploy your Docusaurus sites to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), first make sure the following options are properly configured:

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
export default {
  // highlight-start
  url: 'https://docusaurus-2.netlify.app', // Url to your site with no trailing slash
  baseUrl: '/', // Base directory of your site relative to your repo
  // highlight-end
  // ...
};
```

Then, [create your site with Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/start).

While you set up the site, specify the build commands and directories as follows:

- build command: `npm run build`
- publish directory: `build`

If you did not configure these build options, you may still go to "Site settings" -> "Build & deploy" after your site is created.

Once properly configured with the above options, your site should deploy and automatically redeploy upon merging to your deploy branch, which defaults to `main`.

:::warning

Some Docusaurus sites put the `docs` folder outside of `website` (most likely former Docusaurus v1 sites):

```bash
repo           # git root
├── docs       # MD files
└── website    # Docusaurus root
```

If you decide to use the `website` folder as Netlify's base directory, Netlify will not trigger builds when you update the `docs` folder, and you need to configure a [custom `ignore` command](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/common-configurations/ignore-builds/):

```toml title="website/netlify.toml"
[build]
  ignore = "git diff --quiet $CACHED_COMMIT_REF $COMMIT_REF . ../docs/"
```

:::

:::warning

By default, Netlify adds trailing slashes to Docusaurus URLs.

It is recommended to disable the Netlify setting `Post Processing > Asset Optimization > Pretty Urls` to prevent lowercase URLs, unnecessary redirects, and 404 errors.

**Be very careful**: the `Disable asset optimization` global checkbox is broken and does not really disable the `Pretty URLs` setting in practice. Please make sure to **uncheck it independently**.

If you want to keep the `Pretty Urls` Netlify setting on, adjust the `trailingSlash` Docusaurus config appropriately.

Refer to [slorber/trailing-slash-guide](https://github.com/slorber/trailing-slash-guide) for more information.

:::

## Deploying to Vercel {#deploying-to-vercel}

Deploying your Docusaurus project to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) will provide you with [various benefits](https://vercel.com/) in the areas of performance and ease of use.

To deploy your Docusaurus project with a [Vercel for Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git), make sure it has been pushed to a Git repository.

Import the project into Vercel using the [Import Flow](https://vercel.com/import/git). During the import, you will find all relevant options preconfigured for you; however, you can choose to change any of these [options](https://vercel.com/docs/build-step#build-&-development-settings).

After your project has been imported, all subsequent pushes to branches will generate [Preview Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/platform/deployments#preview), and all changes made to the [Production Branch](https://vercel.com/docs/git-integrations#production-branch) (usually "main" or "master") will result in a [Production Deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/platform/deployments#production).

## Deploying to GitHub Pages {#deploying-to-github-pages}

Docusaurus provides an easy way to publish to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which comes free with every GitHub repository.

### Overview {#github-pages-overview}

Usually, there are two repositories (at least two branches) involved in a publishing process: the branch containing the source files, and the branch containing the build output to be served with GitHub Pages. In the following tutorial, they will be referred to as **"source"** and **"deployment"**, respectively.

Each GitHub repository is associated with a GitHub Pages service. If the deployment repository is called `my-org/my-project` (where `my-org` is the organization name or username), the deployed site will appear at `https://my-org.github.io/my-project/`. If the deployment repository is called `my-org/my-org.github.io` (the _organization GitHub Pages repo_), the site will appear at `https://my-org.github.io/`.

:::info

In case you want to use your custom domain for GitHub Pages, create a `CNAME` file in the `static` directory. Anything within the `static` directory will be copied to the root of the `build` directory for deployment. When using a custom domain, you should be able to move back from `baseUrl: '/projectName/'` to `baseUrl: '/'`, and also set your `url` to your custom domain.

You may refer to GitHub Pages' documentation [User, Organization, and Project Pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages) for more details.

:::

GitHub Pages picks up deploy-ready files (the output from `docusaurus build`) from the default branch (`master` / `main`, usually) or the `gh-pages` branch, and either from the root or the `/docs` folder. You can configure that through `Settings > Pages` in your repository. This branch will be called the "deployment branch".

We provide a `docusaurus deploy` command that helps you deploy your site from the source branch to the deployment branch in one command: clone, build, and commit.

### `docusaurus.config.js` settings {#docusaurusconfigjs-settings}

First, modify your `docusaurus.config.js` and add the following params:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `organizationName` | The GitHub user or organization that owns the deployment repository. |
| `projectName` | The name of the deployment repository. |
| `deploymentBranch` | The name of the deployment branch. It defaults to `'gh-pages'` for non-organization GitHub Pages repos (`projectName` not ending in `.github.io`). Otherwise, it needs to be explicit as a config field or environment variable. |

These fields also have their environment variable counterparts which have a higher priority: `ORGANIZATION_NAME`, `PROJECT_NAME`, and `DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH`.

:::warning

GitHub Pages adds a trailing slash to Docusaurus URLs by default. It is recommended to set a `trailingSlash` config (`true` or `false`, not `undefined`).

:::

Example:

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
export default {
  // ...
  url: 'https://endiliey.github.io', // Your website URL
  baseUrl: '/',
  // highlight-start
  projectName: 'endiliey.github.io',
  organizationName: 'endiliey',
  trailingSlash: false,
  // highlight-end
  // ...
};
```

:::warning

By default, GitHub Pages runs published files through [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Since Jekyll will discard any files that begin with `_`, it is recommended that you disable Jekyll by adding an empty file named `.nojekyll` file to your `static` directory.

:::

### Environment settings {#environment-settings}

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `USE_SSH` | Set to `true` to use SSH instead of the default HTTPS for the connection to the GitHub repo. If the source repo URL is an SSH URL (e.g. `git@github.com:facebook/docusaurus.git`), `USE_SSH` is inferred to be `true`. |
| `GIT_USER` | The username for a GitHub account that **has push access to the deployment repo**. For your own repositories, this will usually be your GitHub username. Required if not using SSH, and ignored otherwise. |
| `GIT_PASS` | Personal access token of the git user (specified by `GIT_USER`), to facilitate non-interactive deployment (e.g. continuous deployment) |
| `CURRENT_BRANCH` | The source branch. Usually, the branch will be `main` or `master`, but it could be any branch except for `gh-pages`. If nothing is set for this variable, then the current branch from which `docusaurus deploy` is invoked will be used. |
| `GIT_USER_NAME` | The `git config user.name` value to use when pushing to the deployment repo |
| `GIT_USER_EMAIL` | The `git config user.email` value to use when pushing to the deployment repo |

GitHub enterprise installations should work in the same manner as github.com; you only need to set the organization's GitHub Enterprise host as an environment variable:

| Name          | Description                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `GITHUB_HOST` | The domain name of your GitHub enterprise site. |
| `GITHUB_PORT` | The port of your GitHub enterprise site.        |

### 部署 {#deploy}

最後，要將您的網站部署到 GitHub Pages，請執行：

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
```

```bash
GIT_USER=<GITHUB_USERNAME> yarn deploy
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
```

```batch
cmd /C "set "GIT_USER=<GITHUB_USERNAME>" && yarn deploy"
```

```mdx-code-block

```

```powershell
cmd /C 'set "GIT_USER=<GITHUB_USERNAME>" && yarn deploy'
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

:::warning

自 2021 年 8 月起，GitHub 要求所有命令行登入都必須使用 **個人存取權杖 (PAT)** 而非密碼。當 GitHub 提示輸入密碼時，請改為輸入 PAT。詳情請參閱 [GitHub 文件](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)。

或者，您也可以使用 SSH (`USE_SSH=true`) 登入。

### 使用 GitHub Actions 觸發部署 {#triggering-deployment-with-github-actions}

[GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions) 讓您可以直接在儲存庫中自動化、自訂並執行軟體開發工作流程。

以下工作流程範例假設您的網站原始碼位於儲存庫的 `main` 分支（_來源分支_ 為 `main`），且您的 [發布來源](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) 已設定為 [使用自訂 GitHub Actions 工作流程發布](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow)。

我們的目標是：

1. 當有新的拉取請求提交到 `main` 時，會有一個動作確保網站能成功建置，但不會實際部署。此工作稱為 `test-deploy`。
2. 當拉取請求合併到 `main` 分支或有人直接推送到 `main` 分支時，將會建置並部署到 GitHub Pages。此工作稱為 `deploy`。

以下是兩種使用 GitHub Actions 部署文件的方法。根據您的部署分支 (`gh-pages`) 位置，選擇下方相關的標籤：

- 來源儲存庫和部署儲存庫為 **同一個** 儲存庫。
- 部署儲存庫是一個 **遠端** 儲存庫，與來源不同。此情境的說明假設 [發布來源](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) 是 `gh-pages` 分支。

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="same" label="Same">
```

雖然您可以將兩個工作定義在同一個工作流程檔案中，但原始的 `deploy` 工作流程在 PR 檢查套件狀態中總是會顯示為已跳過，這無法反映實際狀態，也對審查流程沒有幫助。因此，我們建議改為將它們管理為獨立的工作流程。

These files assume you are using Yarn. If you use npm, change `cache: yarn`, `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`, `yarn build` to `cache: npm`, `npm ci`, `npm run build` accordingly.

If your Docusaurus project is not at the root of your repo, you may need to configure a [default working directory](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-set-the-default-shell-and-working-directory), and adjust the paths accordingly.

跨儲存庫發布的設定較為複雜，因為您需要有權限檢查才能推送到另一個儲存庫。我們將使用 SSH 進行驗證。

1. 生成一個新的 [SSH 金鑰](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)。由於此 SSH 金鑰將用於 CI 環境，請確保不要輸入任何密碼。
2. 預設情況下，您的公鑰應已建立於 `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`；否則，請使用上一步中提供的名稱將金鑰添加到 [GitHub 部署金鑰](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/)。
3. 使用 `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` 將金鑰複製到剪貼簿，並將其作為 [部署金鑰](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys) 貼到部署儲存庫中。如果命令列無法使用，請直接複製檔案內容。在儲存部署金鑰前，勾選 `允許寫入存取` 的選項。
4. 您需要將私鑰設定為 [GitHub 秘密](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets)，以允許 Docusaurus 為您執行部署。
5. 使用 `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa` 複製您的私鑰，並在來源儲存庫中建立一個名為 `GH_PAGES_DEPLOY` 的 GitHub 秘密。如果命令列無法使用，請直接複製檔案內容。儲存您的秘密。
6. 在 `.github/workflows/` 目錄中建立您的 [文件工作流程](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/use-cases-and-examples/creating-an-example-workflow)。在此範例中，它是 `deploy.yml` 檔案。

此時，您應該具備：

- 已設定 GitHub 工作流程且將私鑰 SSH 金鑰設為 GitHub 秘密的來源儲存庫，以及
- 在 GitHub 部署金鑰中設定了公鑰 SSH 金鑰的部署儲存庫。

<summary>Site not deployed properly?</summary>

After pushing to main, if you don't see your site published at the desired location (for example, it says "There isn't a GitHub Pages site here", or it's showing your repo's README.md file), try the following:

- Wait about three minutes and refresh. It may take a few minutes for GitHub pages to pick up the new files.
- Check your repo's landing page for a little green tick next to the last commit's title, indicating the CI has passed. If you see a cross, it means the build or deployment failed, and you should check the log for more debugging information.
- Click on the tick and make sure you see a "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow. Names like "pages build and deployment / deploy" are GitHub's default workflows, indicating your custom deployment workflow failed to be triggered at all. Make sure the YAML files are placed under the `.github/workflows` folder, and that the trigger condition is set correctly (e.g., if your default branch is "master" instead of "main", you need to change the `on.push` property).
- Under your repo's Settings > Pages, make sure the "Source" (which is the source for the _deployment_ files, not "source" as in our terminology) is set to "gh-pages" + "/ (root)", since we are using `gh-pages` as the deployment branch.

If you are using a custom domain:

- Verify that you have the correct DNS records set up if you're using a custom domain. See [GitHub pages documentation on configuring custom domains](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages). Also, please be aware that it may take up to 24 hours for DNS changes to propagate through the internet.

### 使用 Travis CI 觸發部署 {#triggering-deployment-with-travis-ci}

持續整合 (CI) 服務通常用於在每次新提交檢入原始碼控制時執行例行任務。這些任務可以是執行單元測試和整合測試、自動化建置、將套件發佈到 npm，以及將變更部署到您的網站。要自動化網站的部署，您只需在網站更新時呼叫 `yarn deploy` 腳本即可。以下部分介紹如何使用 [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/)（一個流行的持續整合服務提供商）來實現這一點。

1. 前往 https://github.com/settings/tokens 並生成一個新的 [個人存取權杖](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/)。在建立權杖時，授予其 `repo` 範圍，以便其擁有所需的權限。
2. 使用您的 GitHub 帳戶，[將 Travis CI 應用程式](https://github.com/marketplace/travis-ci) 添加到您要啟用的儲存庫。
3. 開啟您的 Travis CI 儀表板。網址類似於 `https://travis-ci.com/USERNAME/REPO`，並導航至您的儲存庫的 `更多選項 > 設定 > 環境變數` 部分。
4. 建立一個名為 `GH_TOKEN` 的新環境變數，其值為您新生成的權杖，然後是 `GH_EMAIL`（您的電子郵件地址）和 `GH_NAME`（您的 GitHub 使用者名稱）。
5. 在儲存庫的根目錄中建立一個 `.travis.yml`，內容如下：

```yml title=".travis.yml"
language: node_js
node_js:
  - 18
branches:
  only:
    - main
cache:
  yarn: true
script:
  - git config --global user.name "${GH_NAME}"
  - git config --global user.email "${GH_EMAIL}"
  - echo "machine github.com login ${GH_NAME} password ${GH_TOKEN}" > ~/.netrc
  - yarn install
  - GIT_USER="${GH_NAME}" yarn deploy
```

現在，每當有新提交進入 `main` 分支時，Travis CI 將執行您的測試套件，如果一切通過，您的網站將透過 `yarn deploy` 腳本進行部署。

### 使用 Buddy 觸發部署 {#triggering-deployment-with-buddy}

[Buddy](https://buddy.works/) 是一個易於使用的 CI/CD 工具，可讓您自動將入口網站部署到不同的環境，包括 GitHub Pages。

按照以下步驟建立一個管道，以便在您將變更推送到所選專案分支時自動部署新版本的網站：

1. 前往 https://github.com/settings/tokens 生成新的[個人存取權杖](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/)。建立權杖時，請授予其 `repo` 範圍以確保具備所需權限。
2. 登入您的 Buddy 帳戶並建立新專案。
3. 選擇 GitHub 作為 git 託管供應商，並選取包含網站程式碼的儲存庫。
4. 使用左側導覽面板切換至 `Pipelines` 檢視。
5. 建立新管線。定義其名稱，將觸發模式設為 `On push`，並選取觸發管線執行的分支。
6. 新增 `Node.js` 動作。
7. 在動作的終端機中新增以下指令：

```bash
GIT_USER=<GH_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>
git config --global user.email "<YOUR_GH_EMAIL>"
git config --global user.name "<YOUR_GH_USERNAME>"
yarn deploy
```

建立此簡單管線後，每次推送至您選定分支的新提交都會使用 `yarn deploy` 將網站部署至 GitHub Pages。閱讀[本指南](https://buddy.works/guides/react-docusaurus)以瞭解更多關於為 Docusaurus 設定 CI/CD 管線的資訊。

### 使用 Azure Pipelines {#using-azure-pipelines}

1. 若尚未註冊，請先於 [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/) 註冊。
2. 建立組織。在組織內建立專案並從 GitHub 連接您的儲存庫。
3. 前往 https://github.com/settings/tokens 生成具有 `repo` 範圍的新[個人存取權杖](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/)。
4. 在專案頁面（網址類似 `https://dev.azure.com/ORG_NAME/REPO_NAME/_build`）中，使用以下文字建立新管線。同時點擊編輯並新增名為 `GH_TOKEN` 的環境變數，其值為您新生成的權杖，接著新增 `GH_EMAIL`（您的電子郵件地址）和 `GH_NAME`（您的 GitHub 使用者名稱）。請確保將其標記為秘密。或者，您也可以在儲存庫根目錄新增名為 `azure-pipelines.yml` 的檔案。

```yml title="azure-pipelines.yml"
trigger:
  - main

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:
  - checkout: self
    persistCredentials: true

  - task: NodeTool@0
    inputs:
      versionSpec: '18'
    displayName: Install Node.js

  - script: |
      git config --global user.name "${GH_NAME}"
      git config --global user.email "${GH_EMAIL}"
      git checkout -b main
      echo "machine github.com login ${GH_NAME} password ${GH_TOKEN}" > ~/.netrc
      yarn install
      GIT_USER="${GH_NAME}" yarn deploy
    env:
      GH_NAME: $(GH_NAME)
      GH_EMAIL: $(GH_EMAIL)
      GH_TOKEN: $(GH_TOKEN)
    displayName: Install and build
```

### 使用 Drone {#using-drone}

1. 建立新的 SSH 金鑰作為專案的[部署金鑰](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys)。
2. 為您的私鑰和公鑰命名，使其具有特定性且不會覆蓋其他 [SSH 金鑰](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)。
3. 前往 `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO/settings/keys` 並新增部署金鑰，貼入您剛生成的公鑰。
4. 開啟您的 Drone.io 儀表板並登入。網址類似 `https://cloud.drone.io/USERNAME/REPO`。
5. 點擊儲存庫，點擊啟用儲存庫，並新增名為 `git_deploy_private_key` 的秘密，其值為您剛生成的私鑰。
6. 在儲存庫根目錄建立 `.drone.yml` 檔案，內容如下。

```yml title=".drone.yml"
kind: pipeline
type: docker
trigger:
  event:
    - tag
- name: Website
  image: node
  commands:
    - mkdir -p $HOME/.ssh
    - ssh-keyscan -t rsa github.com >> $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts
    - echo "$GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY" > "$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa"
    - chmod 0600 $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
    - cd website
    - yarn install
    - yarn deploy
  environment:
    USE_SSH: true
    GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY:
      from_secret: git_deploy_private_key
```

現在，每當您推送新標籤至 GitHub 時，此觸發器將啟動 drone CI 作業以發佈您的網站。

   - The **Directory with app** points at the directory that will contain the project's files after the build. If you selected the repository with the contents of the website (or `my_website`) directory during Step 2, you can leave it empty.

   - The standard build command for Docusaurus is:

     ```bash npm2yarn
     npm run build
     ```

   - You can modify the build command if needed. You can enter multiple commands separated by `&&`.

4. Deploy.

   - Click **Deploy** to start the build process.

   - Once it starts, you will enter the deployment log. If there are any issues with the code, you will get warning or error messages in the log specifying the cause of the problem. Usually, the log contains all the debugging data you'll need.

   - When the deployment is complete, you will receive an email notification and also see a log entry. All done! Your project is up and ready.

## Deploying to Surge {#deploying-to-surge}

Surge is a [static web hosting platform](https://surge.sh/help/getting-started-with-surge) that you can use to deploy your Docusaurus project from the command line in seconds. Deploying your project to Surge is easy and free (including custom domains and SSL certs).

Deploy your app in a matter of seconds using Surge with the following steps:

1. First, install Surge using npm by running the following command:
   ```bash npm2yarn
   npm install -g surge
   ```
2. To build the static files of your site for production in the root directory of your project, run:
   ```bash npm2yarn
   npm run build
   ```
3. Then, run this command inside the root directory of your project:
   ```bash
   surge build/
   ```

First-time users of Surge would be prompted to create an account from the command line (which happens only once).

Confirm that the site you want to publish is in the `build` directory. A randomly generated subdomain `*.surge.sh subdomain` is always given (which can be edited).

### Using your domain {#using-your-domain}

If you have a domain name you can deploy your site using the command:

```bash
surge build/ your-domain.com
```

Your site is now deployed for free at `subdomain.surge.sh` or `your-domain.com` depending on the method you chose.

### Setting up CNAME file {#setting-up-cname-file}

Store your domain in a CNAME file for future deployments with the following command:

```bash
echo subdomain.surge.sh > CNAME
```

You can deploy any other changes in the future with the command `surge`.
