---

The most fundamental component for building a UI, `View` is a container that supports layout with [flexbox](flexbox.md), [style](style.md), [some touch handling](handling-touches.md), and [accessibility](accessibility.md) controls. `View` maps directly to the native view equivalent on whatever platform React Native is running on, whether that is a `UIView`, `<div>`, `android.view`, etc.

`View` is designed to be nested inside other views and can have 0 to many children of any type.

This example creates a `View` that wraps two boxes with color and a text component in a row with padding.

```SnackPlayer name=View%20Example
import React from 'react';
import {View, Text} from 'react-native';

const ViewBoxesWithColorAndText = () => {
  return (
    <View
      style={{
        flexDirection: 'row',
        height: 100,
        padding: 20,
      }}>
      <View style={{backgroundColor: 'blue', flex: 0.3}} />
      <View style={{backgroundColor: 'red', flex: 0.5}} />
      <Text>Hello World!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default ViewBoxesWithColorAndText;
```

> `View`s are designed to be used with [`StyleSheet`](style.md) for clarity and performance, although inline styles are also supported.

### Synthetic Touch Events

For `View` responder props (e.g., `onResponderMove`), the synthetic touch event passed to them are in form of [PressEvent](pressevent).

| Type |
| ---- |
| bool |

---

### `focusable` <div class="label android">Android</div>

Whether this `View` should be focusable with a non-touch input device, eg. receive focus with a hardware keyboard.

| Type    |
| ------- |
| boolean |

---

### `hitSlop`

This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view. Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least 30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels.

For example, if a touchable view has a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with `hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}`

> The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch hits two overlapping views.

| Type                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| object: `{top: number, left: number, bottom: number, right: number}` |

---

### `id`

Used to locate this view from native classes. Has precedence over `nativeID` prop.

> This disables the 'layout-only view removal' optimization for this view!

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

---

### `importantForAccessibility` <div class="label android">Android</div>

Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen. Works for Android only.

Possible values:

- `'auto'` - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
- `'yes'` - The view is important for accessibility.
- `'no'` - The view is not important for accessibility.
- `'no-hide-descendants'` - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.

See the [Android `importantForAccessibility` docs](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility) for reference.

| Type                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------ |
| enum('auto', 'yes', 'no', 'no-hide-descendants') |

---

### `nativeID`

Used to locate this view from native classes.

> This disables the 'layout-only view removal' optimization for this view!

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

---

### `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`

Whether this `View` needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior. The default (`false`) falls back to drawing the component and its children with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value. This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the `View` you are setting an opacity on has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping `View`s, or text and a background).

Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default. If you do need to enable this property for an animation, consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view **contents** are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame). If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once, saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.

| Type |
| ---- |
| bool |

---

### `nextFocusDown` <div class="label android">Android</div>

| Type     |
| -------- |
| function |

---

### `onMoveShouldSetResponder`

Does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness? This is called for every touch move on the `View` when it is not the responder.

| Type                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `md ({nativeEvent: [PressEvent](pressevent)}) => boolean` |

---

### `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`

If a parent `View` wants to prevent a child `View` from becoming responder on a move, it should have this handler which returns `true`.

| --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `md ({nativeEvent: [PressEvent](pressevent)}) => boolean` |

---

### `onResponderGrant`

The View is now responding for touch events. This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening.

On Android, return true from this callback to prevent any other native components from becoming responder until this responder terminates.

| Type                                                              |

| ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `md ({nativeEvent: [PressEvent](pressevent)}) => void` |

---

### `onResponderTerminate`

The responder has been taken from the `View`. Might be taken by other views after a call to `onResponderTerminationRequest`, or might be taken by the OS without asking (e.g., happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)

| Type                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `md ({nativeEvent: [PressEvent](pressevent)}) => void` |

---

### `onResponderTerminationRequest`

Some other `View` wants to become responder and is asking this `View` to release its responder. Returning `true` allows its release.

| Type                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ |

| --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `md ({nativeEvent: [PressEvent](pressevent)}) => boolean` |

---

### `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`

If a parent `View` wants to prevent a child `View` from becoming responder on a touch start, it should have this handler which returns `true`.

| Type                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `md ({nativeEvent: [PressEvent](pressevent)}) => boolean` |

---

### `pointerEvents`

Controls whether the `View` can be the target of touch events.

- `'auto'`: 該視圖可以成為觸摸事件的目標。
- `'none'`: 該視圖永遠不會成為觸摸事件的目標。
- `'box-none'`: 該視圖本身不會成為觸摸事件的目標，但其子視圖可以。其行為類似於在 CSS 中具有以下類別的視圖：

```css
.box-none {
  pointer-events: none;
}
.box-none * {
  pointer-events: auto;
}
```

- `'box-only'`: 該視圖可以成為觸摸事件的目標，但其子視圖不能。其行為類似於在 CSS 中具有以下類別的視圖：

```css
.box-only {
  pointer-events: auto;
}
.box-only * {
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

| Type                                         |
| -------------------------------------------- |
| enum('box-none', 'none', 'box-only', 'auto') |

---

### `removeClippedSubviews`

這是一個由 `RCTView` 公開的保留性能屬性，對於滾動包含大量子視圖（其中大部分位於屏幕外）的內容非常有用。要使此屬性生效，必須將其應用於包含許多超出其邊界的子視圖的視圖。子視圖還必須具有 `overflow: hidden`，包含視圖（或其父視圖之一）也應如此。

| Type |
| ---- |
| bool |

---

### `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid` <div class="label android">Android</div>

此 `View` 是否應將自身（及其所有子視圖）渲染為 GPU 上的單個硬件紋理。

在 Android 上，這對於僅修改不透明度、旋轉、平移和/或縮放的動畫和交互非常有用：在這些情況下，視圖不需要重新繪製，顯示列表也不需要重新執行。紋理可以重複使用並以不同的參數重新合成。缺點是這可能會消耗有限的視頻內存，因此應在交互/動畫結束後將此屬性設置回 false。

| Type |
| ---- |
| bool |

---

### `role`

`role` 向輔助技術的用戶傳達組件的用途。其優先級高於 [`accessibilityRole`](view#accessibilityrole) 屬性。

| Type                       |
| -------------------------- |
| [Role](accessibility#role) |

---

### `shouldRasterizeIOS` <div class="label ios">iOS</div>

此 `View` 是否應在合成之前渲染為位圖。

在 iOS 上，這對於不修改此組件尺寸或其子組件的動畫和交互非常有用；例如，當平移靜態視圖的位置時，柵格化允許渲染器重用靜態視圖的緩存位圖，並在每一幀中快速合成。

柵格化會導致離屏繪製過程，且位圖會消耗內存。使用此屬性時應進行測試和測量。

| Type |
| ---- |
| bool |

| ------------------------------ |
| [View Style](view-style-props) |

---

### `tabIndex` <div class="label android">Android</div>

此 `View` 是否應可通過非觸摸輸入設備（例如硬件鍵盤）獲得焦點。
支持以下值：

- `0` - 視圖可獲得焦點
- `-1` - 視圖不可獲得焦點

| Type        |
| ----------- |
| enum(0, -1) |

---

### `testID`

用於在端到端測試中定位此視圖。
