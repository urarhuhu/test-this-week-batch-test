# Swizzling

In this section, we will introduce how customization of layout is done in Docusaurus.

> Déjà vu...?

This section is similar to [Styling and Layout](./styling-layout.mdx), but this time, we will customize React components themselves, rather than what they look like. We will talk about a central concept in Docusaurus: **swizzling**, which allows **deeper site customizations**.

In practice, swizzling permits to **swap a theme component with your own implementation**, and it comes in 2 patterns:

- [**Ejecting**](#ejecting): creates a **copy** of the original theme component, which you can fully **customize**
- [**Wrapping**](#wrapping): creates a **wrapper** around the original theme component, which you can **enhance**

<details>

<summary>Why is it called swizzling?</summary>

**The name comes from Objective-C and Swift-UI**: [method swizzling](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2019/swizzling-in-swift/) is the process of changing the implementation of an existing selector (method).

**For Docusaurus, component swizzling means providing an alternative component that takes precedence over the component provided by the theme.**

You can think of it as [Monkey Patching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch) for React components, enabling you to override the default implementation. Gatsby has a similar concept called [theme shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/shadowing/).

To gain a deeper understanding of this, you have to understand [how theme components are resolved](./advanced/client.mdx#theme-aliases).

</details>

## Swizzling Process

### Overview

Docusaurus provides a convenient **interactive CLI** to swizzle components. You generally only need to remember the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run swizzle
```

It will generate a new component in your `src/theme` directory, which should look like this example:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Ejecting">
```

```jsx title="src/theme/SomeComponent.js"
import React from 'react';

export default function SomeComponent(props) {
  // You can fully customize this implementation
  // including changing the JSX, CSS and React hooks
  return (
    <div className="some-class">
      <h1>Some Component</h1>
      <p>Some component implementation details</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Wrapping">
```

```jsx title="src/theme/SomeComponent.js"
import React from 'react';
import SomeComponent from '@theme-original/SomeComponent';

export default function SomeComponentWrapper(props) {
  // You can enhance the original component,
  // including adding extra props or JSX elements around it
  return (
    <>
      <SomeComponent {...props} />
    </>
  );
}
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

To get an overview of all the themes and components available to swizzle, run:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run swizzle -- --list
```

Use `--help` to see all available CLI options, or refer to the reference [swizzle CLI documentation](./cli.mdx#docusaurus-swizzle).

:::tip[Removing Unneeded Swizzled Components]

If you decide that a previously swizzled component is no longer necessary, you can simply remove its file(s) from the `src/theme` directory. After removing the component, make sure to restart your development server to ensure the changes are properly reflected.

:::

:::note

After swizzling a component, **restart your dev server** in order for Docusaurus to know about the new component.

:::

:::warning[Prefer staying on the safe side]

Be sure to understand [which components are **safe to swizzle**](#what-is-safe-to-swizzle). Some components are **internal implementation details** of a theme.

:::

:::info

`docusaurus swizzle` is only an automated way to help you swizzle the component. You can also create the `src/theme/SomeComponent.js` file manually, and Docusaurus will [resolve it](./advanced/client.mdx#theme-aliases). There's no internal magic behind this command!

:::

### Ejecting {#ejecting}

Ejecting a theme component is the process of **creating a copy** of the original theme component, which you can **fully customize and override**.

To eject a theme component, use the swizzle CLI interactively, or with the `--eject` option:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run swizzle [theme name] [component name] -- --eject
```

An example:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic Footer -- --eject
```

This will copy the current `<Footer />` component's implementation to your site's `src/theme` directory. Docusaurus will now use this `<Footer>` component copy instead of the original one. You are now free to completely re-implement the `<Footer>` component.

```jsx title="src/theme/Footer/index.js"
import React from 'react';

export default function Footer(props) {
  return (
    <footer>
      <h1>This is my custom site footer</h1>
      <p>And it is very different from the original</p>
    </footer>
  );
}
```

:::warning

Ejecting an [**unsafe**](#what-is-safe-to-swizzle) component can sometimes lead to copying a large amount of internal code, which you now have to maintain yourself. It can make Docusaurus upgrades more difficult, as you will need to migrate your customizations if the props received or internal theme APIs used have changed.

**Prefer [wrapping](#wrapping) whenever possible**: the amount of code to maintain is smaller.

:::

:::tip[Re-swizzling]

To keep ejected components up-to-date after a Docusaurus upgrade, re-run the eject command and compare the changes with `git diff`. You are also recommended to write a brief comment at the top of the file explaining what changes you have made, so that you could more easily re-apply your changes after re-ejection.

:::

### Wrapping {#wrapping}

Wrapping a theme component is the process of **creating a wrapper** around the original theme component, which you can **enhance**.

To wrap a theme component, use the swizzle CLI interactively, or with the `--wrap` option:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run swizzle [theme name] [component name] -- --wrap
```

An example:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic Footer -- --wrap
```

This will create a wrapper in your site's `src/theme` directory. Docusaurus will now use the `<FooterWrapper>` component instead of the original one. You can now add customizations around the original component.

```jsx title="src/theme/Footer/index.js"
import React from 'react';
import Footer from '@theme-original/Footer';

export default function FooterWrapper(props) {
  return (
    <>
      <section>
        <h2>Extra section</h2>
        <p>This is an extra section that appears above the original footer</p>
      </section>
      <Footer {...props} />
    </>
  );
}
```

<details>
  <summary>What is this <code>@theme-original</code> thing?</summary>

Docusaurus uses [theme aliases](./advanced/client.mdx#theme-aliases) to resolve the theme components to use. The newly created wrapper takes the `@theme/SomeComponent` alias. `@theme-original/SomeComponent` permits to import original component that the wrapper shadows without creating an infinite import loop where the wrapper imports itself.

</details>

:::tip

Wrapping a theme is a great way to **add extra components around existing one** without [ejecting](#ejecting) it. For example, you can easily add a custom comment system under each blog post:

```jsx title="src/theme/BlogPostItem.js"
import React from 'react';
import BlogPostItem from '@theme-original/BlogPostItem';
import MyCustomCommentSystem from '@site/src/MyCustomCommentSystem';

export default function BlogPostItemWrapper(props) {
  return (
    <>
      <BlogPostItem {...props} />
      <MyCustomCommentSystem />
    </>
  );
}
```

## What is safe to swizzle? {#what-is-safe-to-swizzle}

> With great power comes great responsibility

Some theme components are **internal implementation details** of a theme. Docusaurus allows you to swizzle them, but it **might be risky**.

<details>

<summary>Why is it risky?</summary>

Theme authors (including us) might have to update their theme over time: changing the component props, name, file system location, types... For example, consider a component that receives two props `name` and `age`, but after a refactor, it now receives a `person` prop with the above two properties. Your component, which still expects these two props, will render `undefined` instead.

Moreover, internal components may simply disappear. If a component is called `Sidebar` and it's later renamed to `DocSidebar`, your swizzled component will be completely ignored.

**Theme components marked as unsafe may change in a backward-incompatible way between theme minor versions.** When upgrading a theme (or Docusaurus), your customizations might **behave unexpectedly**, and can even **break your site**.

</details>

For each theme component, the swizzle CLI will indicate **3 different levels of safety** declared by theme authors:

- **Safe**: this component is safe to be swizzled, its public API is considered stable, and no breaking changes should happen within a theme **major version**
- **Unsafe**: this component is a theme implementation detail, not safe to be swizzled, and breaking changes might happen within a theme **minor version**
- **Forbidden**: the swizzle CLI will prevent you from swizzling this component, because it is not designed to be swizzled at all

:::note

Some components might be safe to wrap, but not safe to eject.

:::

:::info

Don't be too **afraid to swizzle unsafe components**: just keep in mind that **breaking changes** might happen, and you might need to upgrade your customizations manually on minor version upgrades.

:::

:::note[Report your use-case]

If you have a **strong use-case for swizzling an unsafe component**, please [**report it here**](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/discussions/5468) and we will work together to find a solution to make it safe.

:::

## Which component should I swizzle? {#which-component-should-i-swizzle}

It is not always clear which component you should swizzle exactly to achieve the desired result. `@docusaurus/theme-classic`, which provides most of the theme components, has about [100 components](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/docusaurus-theme-classic/src/theme)!

:::tip

若要列印所有 `@docusaurus/theme-classic` 元件的概覽：

```bash npm2yarn
npm run swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic -- --list
```

:::

您可以按照以下步驟來定位需要替換的適當元件：

1. **元件描述。** 部分元件提供簡短說明，這是找到正確元件的好方法。
2. **元件名稱。** 官方主題元件皆採用語義化命名，因此您應能從名稱推斷其功能。替換 CLI 允許您輸入部分元件名稱來縮小可用選項範圍。例如，若執行 `yarn swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic` 並輸入 `Doc`，則僅會列出與文檔相關的元件。
3. **從高層級元件開始。** 元件會形成樹狀結構，部分元件會導入其他元件。每條路由都會關聯一個頂層元件（大多數列於[內容外掛的路由](./advanced/routing.mdx#routing-in-content-plugins)中）。例如，所有部落格文章頁面的最頂層元件為 `@theme/BlogPostPage`。您可以先替換此元件，再沿元件樹向下定位到僅渲染您目標內容的元件。找到正確元件後，請記得刪除其他替換檔案以避免維護過多元件。
4. **閱讀[主題原始碼](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/docusaurus-theme-classic/src/theme)** 並善用搜尋功能。

:::tip[直接詢問！]

若仍不確定該替換哪個元件以達成預期效果，可透過我們的[支援管道](/community/support)尋求協助。

我們也希望更了解您最精緻的客製化使用案例，請[**提交報告**](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/discussions/5468)。

:::

## 是否需要替換元件？ {#do-i-need-to-swizzle}

替換元件最終意味著您需維護與 Docusaurus 內部 API 互動的 React 程式碼。若可能，在客製化網站時請考慮以下替代方案：

1. **使用 CSS。** CSS 規則與選擇器通常能協助達成相當程度的客製化。詳見[樣式與版面配置](./styling-layout.mdx)。
2. **使用翻譯。** 這可能令人意外，但翻譯本質上也是客製化文字標籤的方式之一。例如，若網站預設語言為 `en`，您仍可執行 `yarn write-translations -l en` 並編輯產生的 `code.json`。詳見[i18n 教學](./i18n/i18n-tutorial.mdx)。

:::tip

**越小越好。** 若必須替換元件，請優先僅替換相關部分並盡量減少自行維護的程式碼量。替換小型元件通常意味著升級時**破壞性變更**的風險較低。

[封裝](#wrapping)也是比[完全替換](#ejecting)更安全的替代方案。

:::

## 使用 `<Root>` 封裝您的網站 {#wrapper-your-site-with-root}

`<Root>` 元件會渲染於 React 樹的**最頂層**，高於主題 `<Layout>` 且**永不卸載**。這是添加不應在導航間重新初始化之狀態邏輯（使用者認證狀態、購物車狀態等）的理想位置。

透過在 `src/theme/Root.js` 建立檔案來**手動**替換：

```js title="src/theme/Root.js"
import React from 'react';

// Default implementation, that you can customize
export default function Root({children}) {
  return <>{children}</>;
}
```

:::tip

可使用此元件來渲染 React Context providers。
