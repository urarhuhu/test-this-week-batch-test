# Introduction

⚡️ Docusaurus will help you ship a **beautiful documentation site in no time**.

💸 Building a custom tech stack is expensive. Instead, **focus on your content** and just write Markdown files.

💥 Ready for more? Use **advanced features** like versioning, i18n, search and theme customizations.

💅 Check the **[best Docusaurus sites](/showcase?tags=favorite)** for inspiration and read some **[testimonials](https://x.com/sebastienlorber/timelines/1392048416872706049)**.

🧐 Docusaurus is a **static-site generator**. It builds a **single-page application** with fast client-side navigation, leveraging the full power of **React** to make your site interactive. It provides out-of-the-box **documentation features** but can be used to create **any kind of site** (personal website, product, blog, marketing landing pages, etc).

## Docusaurus: Documentation Made Easy

In this presentation at [Algolia Community Event](https://www.algolia.com/), [Meta Open Source team](https://opensource.facebook.com/) shared a brief walk-through of Docusaurus. They covered how to get started with the project, enable plugins, and set up functionalities like documentation and blogging.

```mdx-code-block
import LiteYouTubeEmbed from 'react-lite-youtube-embed';

<div className="video-container">
  <LiteYouTubeEmbed
    id="Yhyx7otSksg"
    params="autoplay=1&autohide=1&showinfo=0&rel=0"

## Migrating from v1 {#migrating-from-v1}

Docusaurus v2+ has been a total rewrite from Docusaurus v1, taking advantage of a completely modernized toolchain. After [v2's official release](https://docusaurus.io/blog/2022/08/01/announcing-docusaurus-2.0), we highly encourage you to **use Docusaurus v2+ over Docusaurus v1**, as Docusaurus v1 has been deprecated.

A [lot of users](/showcase) are already using Docusaurus v2+ ([trends](https://www.npmtrends.com/docusaurus-vs-@docusaurus/core)).

**Use Docusaurus v2+ if:**

- :white_check_mark: You want a modern Jamstack documentation site
- :white_check_mark: You want a single-page application (SPA) with client-side routing
- :white_check_mark: You want the full power of React and MDX
- :white_check_mark: You do not need support for IE11

**Use [Docusaurus v1](https://v1.docusaurus.io/) if:**

- :x: You don't want a single-page application (SPA)
- :x: You need support for IE11 (...do you? IE [has already reached end-of-life](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/internet-explorer-11) and is no longer officially supported)

For existing v1 users that are seeking to upgrade to v2+, you can follow our [migration guides](./migration/index.mdx).

## Features {#features}

Docusaurus is built with high attention to the developer and contributor experience.

- ⚛️ **Built with 💚 and React**:
  - Extend and customize with React
  - Gain full control of your site's browsing experience by providing your own React components
- **Pluggable**:
  - Bootstrap your site with a basic template, then use advanced features and plugins
  - Open source your plugins to share with the community
- ✂️ **Developer experience**:
  - Start writing your docs right now
  - Universal configuration entry point to make it more maintainable by contributors
  - Hot reloading with lightning-fast incremental build on changes
  - Route-based code and data splitting
  - Publish to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, and other deployment services with ease

Our shared goal—to help your users quickly find what they need and understand your products better. We share our best practices to help you build your docs site right and well.

- 🎯 **SEO friendly**:
  - HTML files are statically generated for every possible path.
  - Page-specific SEO to help your users land on your official docs directly relating their problems at hand.
- 📝 **Powered by MDX**:
  - Write interactive components via JSX and React embedded in Markdown.
  - Share your code in live editors to get your users to love your products on the spot.
- 🔍 **Search**: Your full site is searchable.
- 💾 **Document Versioning**: Helps you keep documentation in sync with project releases.
- 🌍 **Internationalization (i18n)**: Translate your site in multiple locales.

Docusaurus v2+ is born to be compassionately accessible to all your users, and lightning-fast.

- ⚡️ **Lightning-fast**. Docusaurus v2+ follows the [PRPL Pattern](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/prpl-pattern/) that makes sure your content loads blazing fast.
- 🦖 **Accessible**. Attention to accessibility, making your site equally accessible to all users.

## Design principles {#design-principles}

- **Little to learn**. Docusaurus should be easy to learn and use as the API is quite small. Most things will still be achievable by users, even if it takes them more code and more time to write. Not having abstractions is better than having the wrong abstractions, and we don't want users to have to hack around the wrong abstractions. Mandatory talk—[Minimal API Surface Area](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4anAwXYqLG8).
- **Intuitive**. Users will not feel overwhelmed when looking at the project directory of a Docusaurus project or adding new features. It should look intuitive and easy to build on top of, using approaches they are familiar with.
- **Layered architecture**. The separations of concerns between each layer of our stack (content/theming/styling) should be clear—well-abstracted and modular.
- **Sensible defaults**. Common and popular performance optimizations and configurations will be done for users but they are given the option to override them.
- **No vendor lock-in**. Users are not required to use the default plugins or CSS, although they are highly encouraged to. Certain core infrastructures like React Loadable and React Router cannot be swapped because we do default performance optimization on them, but not higher-level ones. Choice of Markdown engines, CSS frameworks, CSS methodology, and other architectures will be entirely up to users.

We believe that, as developers, knowing how a library works helps us become better at using it. Hence we're dedicating effort to explaining the architecture and various components of Docusaurus with the hope that users reading it will gain a deeper understanding of the tool and be even more proficient in using it.

## Comparison with other tools {#comparison-with-other-tools}

Across all static site generators, Docusaurus has a unique focus on documentation sites and has many out-of-the-box features.

We've also studied other main static site generators and would like to share our insights on the comparison, hopefully helping you navigate through the prismatic choices out there.

### Gatsby {#gatsby}

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) 具備豐富功能與龐大插件生態，能實現 Docusaurus 的所有能力，但代價是較高的學習曲線。Gatsby 是通用型網站建構工具，而 Docusaurus 專注於單一目標——成為最優秀的技術文檔發布工具。

GraphQL 是 Gatsby 的核心設計，但構建靜態網站時通常不需要其提供的靈活性。

Docusaurus v2+ 的諸多設計靈感源自 Gatsby 的優秀特性，是理想的替代方案。

[Docz](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz) 是基於 Gatsby 的文檔網站主題，目前功能完整度低於 Docusaurus。

### Next.js {#nextjs}

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 是流行的混合式 React 框架，雖能構建文檔網站，但缺乏針對文書場景的預設配置，需投入更多開發成本實現 Docusaurus 的開箱功能。

[Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra) 是基於 Next.js 的靜態網站生成器，目前功能完整度低於 Docusaurus。

### VitePress {#vitepress}

[VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) 與 Docusaurus 高度相似——均專注於內容型網站並提供文檔特化功能，但前者基於 Vue 而後者基於 React。若需 Vue 技術棧，VitePress 是理想選擇。

### MkDocs {#mkdocs}

[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) 是 Python 生態的靜態網站生成器，核心價值與 Docusaurus 相近。

若不需單頁應用且無 React 需求，這是個優秀選擇。

[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) 提供了精美的視覺主題。

### Docsify {#docsify}

[Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) 易於快速創建文檔網站，但非靜態生成且對 SEO 不友好。

### GitBook {#gitbook}

[GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) 擁有簡潔設計並被眾多開源項目採用，但其商業化轉型後已逐漸不符合開源文檔需求。可參閱 [Redux 遷移至 Docusaurus 的討論](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/3161)。

現階段 GitBook 僅對開源與非營利團隊免費，Docusaurus 則完全免費。

### Jekyll {#jekyll}

[Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) 是最成熟的靜態網站生成器之一（Facebook 開源網站曾廣泛使用），我們希望延續其簡易的開發體驗。

相較於 Jekyll 的靜態 HTML 與腳本注入模式，Docusaurus 是完整的 React 應用，通過現代前端工具鏈在性能、構建流程與易用性方面樹立新標準。
