Enable Debugging over USB\n\nMost Android devices can only install and run apps downloaded from Google Play, by default. You will need to enable USB Debugging on your device in order to install your app during development.\n\nTo enable USB debugging on your device, you will first need to enable the \"Developer options\" menu by going to **Settings** → **About phone** → **Software information** and then tapping the `Build number` row at the bottom seven times. You can then go back to **Settings** → **Developer options** to enable \"USB debugging\".\n\n### 2. Plug in your device via USB\n\nLet's now set up an Android device to run our React Native projects. Go ahead and plug in your device via USB to your development machine.\n\nNow check that your device is properly connecting to ADB, the Android Debug Bridge, by running `adb devices`.\n\n```shell\n$ adb devices\nList of devices attached\nemulator-5554 offline   # Google emulator\n14ed2fcc device         # Physical device\n```\n\nSeeing `device` in the right column means the device is connected. You must have **only one device connected** at a time.\n\n:::note\nIf you see `unauthorized` in the list you will need to run `adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081` and press allow USB debugging on the device.\n:::\n\n### 3. Run your app\n\nType the following in your command prompt to install and launch your app on the device:\n\n```shell\n$ npx react-native run-android\n```\n\n> If you get a \"bridge configuration isn't available\" error, see [Using adb reverse](running-on-device.md#method-1-using-adb-reverse-recommended).\n\n> Hint: You can also use the `React Native CLI` to generate and run a `Release` build (e.g. `npx react-native run-android --variant=release`).\n\n<h2>Connecting to the development server</h2>\n\nYou can also iterate quickly on a device by connecting to the development server running on your development machine. There are several ways of accomplishing this, depending on whether you have access to a USB cable or a Wi-Fi network.\n\n### Method 1: Using adb reverse (recommended)\n\nYou can use this method if your device is running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or newer, it has USB debugging enabled, and it is connected via USB to your development machine.\n\nRun the following in a command prompt:\n\n```shell\n$ adb -s <device name> reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081\n```\n\nTo find the device name, run the following adb command:\n\n```shell\n$ adb devices\n```\n\nYou can now enable Live reloading from the [Developer menu](debugging.md#accessing-the-in-app-developer-menu). Your app will reload whenever your JavaScript code has changed.\n\n### Method 2: Connect via Wi-Fi\n\nYou can also connect to the development server over Wi-Fi. You'll first need to install the app on your device using a USB cable, but once that has been done you can debug wirelessly by following these instructions. You'll need your development machine's current IP address before proceeding.\n\nYou can find the IP address in **System Preferences** → **Network**.\n\n1. Make sure your laptop and your phone are on the **same** Wi-Fi network.\n2. Open your React Native app on your device.\n3. You'll see a [red screen with an error](debugging.md#in-app-errors-and-warnings). This is OK. The following steps will fix that.\n4. Open the in-app [Developer menu](debugging.md#accessing-the-in-app-developer-menu).\n5. Go to **Dev Settings** → **Debug server host & port for device**.\n6. Type in your machine's IP address and the port of the local dev server (e.g. 10.0.1.1:8081).\n7. Go back to the **Developer menu** and select **Reload JS**.\n\nYou can now enable Live reloading from the [Developer menu](debugging.md#accessing-the-in-app-developer-menu). Your app will reload whenever your JavaScript code has changed.\n\n## Building your app for production\n\nYou have built a great app using React Native, and you are now itching to release it in the Play Store. The process is the same as any other native Android app, with some additional considerations to take into account. Follow the guide for [generating a signed APK](signed-apk-android.md) to learn more.\n\n</TabItem>\n<TabItem value=\"windows\">\n\n[//]: # 'Windows, Android'\n\n### 1.

You can then go back to **Settings** → **Developer options** to enable \"USB debugging\".\n\n### 2. Plug in your device via USB\n\nLet's now set up an Android device to run our React Native projects. Go ahead and plug in your device via USB to your development machine.\n\nNext, check the manufacturer code by using `lsusb` (on mac, you must first [install lsusb](https://github.com/jlhonora/lsusb)). `lsusb` should output something like this:\n\n```bash\n$ lsusb\nBus 002 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp. Integrated Rate Matching Hub\nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 001 Device 003: ID 22b8:2e76 Motorola PCS\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp. Integrated Rate Matching Hub\nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub\nBus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\n```\n\nThese lines represent the USB devices currently connected to your machine.\n\nYou want the line that represents your phone. If you're in doubt, try unplugging your phone and running the command again:\n\n```bash\n$ lsusb\nBus 002 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp. Integrated Rate Matching Hub\nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp.

This is the line that we care about.\n\n`Bus 001 Device 003: ID 22b8:2e76 Motorola PCS`\n\nFrom the above line, you want to grab the first four digits from the device ID:\n\n`22b8:2e76`\n\nIn this case, it's `22b8`. That's the identifier for Motorola.\n\nYou'll need to input this into your udev rules in order to get up and running:\n\n```shell\necho 'SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"22b8\", MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"plugdev\"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android-usb.rules\n```\n\nMake sure that you replace `22b8` with the identifier you get in the above command.\n\nNow check that your device is properly connecting to ADB, the Android Debug Bridge, by running `adb devices`.\n\n```shell\n$ adb devices\nList of devices attached\nemulator-5554 offline   # Google emulator\n14ed2fcc device         # Physical device\n```\n\nSeeing `device` in the right column means the device is connected. You must have **only one device connected** at a time.\n\n### 3. Run your app\n\nType the following in your command prompt to install and launch your app on the device:\n\n```shell\n$ npx react-native run-android\n```\n\n> If you get a \"bridge configuration isn't available\" error, see [Using adb reverse](running-on-device.md#method-1-using-adb-reverse-recommended).\n\n> Hint: You can also use the `React Native CLI` to generate and run a `Release` build (e.g. `npx react-native run-android --variant=release`).\n\n<h2>Connecting to the development server</h2>\n\nYou can also iterate quickly on a device by connecting to the development server running on your development machine.

You'll first need to install the app on your device using a USB cable, but once that has been done you can debug wirelessly by following these instructions. You'll need your development machine's current IP address before proceeding.\n\nOpen a terminal and type `/sbin/ifconfig` to find your machine's IP address.\n\n1. Make sure your laptop and your phone are on the **same** Wi-Fi network.\n2. Open your React Native app on your device.\n3. You'll see a [red screen with an error](debugging.md#in-app-errors-and-warnings). This is OK. The following steps will fix that.\n4.

Plug in your device via USB\n\nConnect your iOS device to your Mac using a USB to Lightning cable. Navigate to the `ios` folder in your project, then open the `.xcodeproj` file, or if you are using CocoaPods open `.xcworkspace`, within it using Xcode.\n\nIf this is your first time running an app on your iOS device, you may need to register your device for development. Open the **Product** menu from Xcode's menubar, then go to **Destination**. Look for and select your device from the list. Xcode will then register your device for development.\n\n### 2. Configure code signing\n\nRegister for an [Apple developer account](https://developer.apple.com/) if you don't have one yet.\n\nSelect your project in the Xcode Project Navigator, then select your main target (it should share the same name as your project). Look for the \"General\" tab. Go to \"Signing\" and make sure your Apple developer account or team is selected under the Team dropdown. Do the same for the tests target (it ends with Tests, and is below your main target).\n\n**Repeat** this step for the **Tests** target in your project.\n\n![](/docs/assets/RunningOnDeviceCodeSigning.png)\n\n### 3. Build and Run your app\n\nIf everything is set up correctly, your device will be listed as the build target in the Xcode toolbar, and it will also appear in the Devices pane (`⇧⌘2`). You can now press the **Build and run** button (`⌘R`) or select **Run** from the **Product** menu. Your app will launch on your device shortly.\n\n![](/docs/assets/RunningOnDeviceReady.png)\n\n> If you run into any issues, please take a look at Apple's [Launching Your App on a Device](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/LaunchingYourApponDevices/LaunchingYourApponDevices.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH27-SW4) docs.\n\n<h2>Connecting to the development server</h2>\n\nYou can also iterate quickly on a device using the development server. You only have to be on the same Wi-Fi network as your computer. Shake your device to open the [Developer menu](debugging.md#accessing-the-in-app-developer-menu), then enable Live Reload. Your app will reload whenever your JavaScript code has changed.\n\n![](/docs/assets/DeveloperMenu.png)\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n> If you have any issues, ensure that your Mac and device are on the same network and can reach each other. Many open wireless networks with captive portals are configured to prevent devices from reaching other devices on the network. You may use your device's Personal Hotspot feature in this case. You may also share your internet (Wi-Fi/Ethernet) connection from your Mac to your device via USB and connect to the bundler through this tunnel for very high transfer speeds.\n\nWhen trying to connect to the development server you might get a [red screen with an error](debugging.md#in-app-errors-and-warnings) saying:\n\n> Connection to `http://localhost:8081/debugger-proxy?role=client` timed out. Are you running node proxy? If you are running on the device, check if you have the right IP address in `RCTWebSocketExecutor.m`.\n\nTo solve this issue check the following points.\n\n#### 1. Wi-Fi network.\n\nMake sure your laptop and your phone are on the **same** Wi-Fi network.\n\n#### 2. IP address\n\nMake sure that the build script detected the IP address of your machine correctly (e.g. 10.0.1.123).\n\n![](/docs/assets/XcodeBuildIP.png)\n\nOpen the **Report navigator** tab, select the last **Build** and search for `IP=` followed by an IP address. The IP address which gets embedded in the app should match your machines IP address.\n\n## Building your app for production\n\nYou have built a great app using React Native, and you are now itching to release it in the App Store. The process is the same as any other native iOS app, with some additional considerations to take into account.
