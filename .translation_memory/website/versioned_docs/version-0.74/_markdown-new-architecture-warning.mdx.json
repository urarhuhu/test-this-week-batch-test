Feel free to share your feedback on the [discussion inside the working group](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-new-architecture/discussions/8) for this page.\n\nMoreover, it contains several **manual steps**. Please note that this won't be representative of the final developer experience once the New Architecture is stable. We're working on tools, templates and libraries to help you get started fast on the New Architecture, without having to go through the whole setup.\n\n:::",
