These pause time improvements can come at the cost of overall throughput, due to the need for more expensive write barriers, slower freelist based allocation (as opposed to a bump pointer allocator), and increased heap fragmentation.

      "source_content": "- [`Proxy` and `Reflect`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Meta_programming) were originally excluded from Hermes because Facebook does not use them. We were also concerned that adding Proxy would hurt property lookup performance even when Proxy is not used. But Proxy quickly become [the most requested feature](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/33) of Hermes due to popular libraries such as [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) and [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/). We carefully evaluated and decided to build it just for the community, and we managed to implement it with very low cost. Since this is a feature we don’t use, we relied on our community to prove its stability. We started by testing Proxy behind a flag and created opt-in npm packages for [release v0.4](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/33#issuecomment-668374607) and [v0.5](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/33#issuecomment-668374607), and it’s [enabled by default starting from v0.7](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/releases/tag/v0.7.0).\n- [ECMAScript Internationalization API Specification (ECMA-402, or `Intl`)](https://hermesengine.dev/docs/intl) was [the second most requested feature](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/23). `Intl` is a huge set of APIs and often requires the implementation to include **6MB worth** of [Unicode CLDR](https://cldr.unicode.org/index) data. This is why polyfills like [FormatJS (a.k.a. `react-intl`)](https://github.com/formatjs/formatjs) and JS engines like the [international variant build of community JSC](https://github.com/react-native-community/jsc-android-buildscripts#international-variant) are so huge. To avoid substantially increasing the binary size of Hermes, we decided to implement it with another strategy by consuming and mapping the ICU facilities provided by the libraries included in the operating systems, at the cost of some (often minor) variance in behaviors across platforms.\n  - Microsoft collaborated to build support on Android. It covers almost everything from ECMA-402 up to ES2020, **with only a size impact as small as 3% (57-62K per ABI)**. We ran [a poll on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tmikov/status/1336442786694893568) and the results were strongly in favor of including `Intl` by default, so that’s what we did and it’s available starting from [release v0.8](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/releases/tag/v0.8.0).\n  - Facebook has sponsored [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io/) to launch a [remote open source fellowship program](https://news.mlh.io/welcoming-facebook-back-as-a-sponsor-of-the-2020-2021-mlh-fellowship-08-12-2020). Last year, we launched the [Hermes sampling profiler](https://reactnative.dev/docs/profile-hermes). This year, our fellows will be working with members from Hermes, React Native, and Callstack, to add support for Hermes `Intl` on iOS. Stayed tuned!\n- We appreciate that people have been working with us to discover issues affecting the community.\n  - People have helped us identify critical spec divergence such as [stability of `Array.prototype.sort`](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/212) amended in [ES2019](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/1340). This has been fixed and will be available in the next release.\n  - People found out that our default heap size limit was too small and caused [unnecessary GC pressure](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/295) and [OOM crashes](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/511) for many users who are not familiar with customizing Hermes’s GC configs. So we increased it from 512MiB to 3GiB to be more than sufficient for most users by default.\n  - People also reported that our specialized `Function.prototype.toString` implementation [caused performance to drop in libraries doing improper feature detection](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/471#issuecomment-820123463) and [blocked users from doing source code injecting](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/114#issuecomment-887106990). This helped us strengthen our stance that Hermes, whenever possible, should not get in the way of developers and to respect de-facto practices.",
