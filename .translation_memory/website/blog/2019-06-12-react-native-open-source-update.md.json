All of the new features are directly using APIs provided by the underlying platform so they‚Äôll integrate with native assistance technologies both on Android and iOS. We‚Äôd like to thank [Marc Mulcahy](https://github.com/marcmulcahy), [Alan Kenyon](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/24746), [Estev√£o Lucas](https://github.com/elucaswork), [Sam Mathias Weggersen](https://github.com/sweggersen) and [Janic Duplessis](https://twitter.com/janicduplessis) for their contributions:\n  - [Additional Accessibility Roles + States](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/24095) and a [new Accessibility States API](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/24608). Added a number of missing accessibility roles for various components and a new API for better web support in the future.\n  - [AccessibilityInfo.announceForAccessibility](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/24746). Added support for Android, previously iOS-only.\n  - [Extended Accessibility Actions Support](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/24695). Added callbacks to deal with accessibility around user-defined actions.\n  - [Support for iOS Accessibility flags](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/23913) and [support for \"reduce motion\"](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/23839).\n  - [Android keyboard accessibility improvements](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/24359). Added a `clickable` prop and an `onClick` callback for invoking actions via keyboard navigation _(note: this will soon be renamed to `focusable`)._\n  - [Use CALayers to draw text](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/24387). Fixed an issue that made scaled-up text disappear on iOS.\n- **New App Screen:** The community came up with a [design for the new app screen](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/122) that is implemented in 0.60. This screen is what most people see when they are first using React Native. It now links first time users to the documentation and the look fits with our upcoming website redesign üåü. Huge thanks to [Orta](https://twitter.com/orta), [Adam Shurson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashurson/), [Glauber Castro](https://github.com/glauberfc), [Karan Singh](https://github.com/karanpratapsingh), [Eli Perkins](https://twitter.com/_eliperkins), [Lucas Bento](https://twitter.com/lbentosilva) and [Eric Lewis](https://twitter.com/ericlewis) for all their work and collaboration!\n  - Check out the new app screen on the ‚Äú_[React Native Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImlAqMZxveg)_‚Äú video series.\n- **TurboModule Types:** The new [TurboModules system](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/40) requires [types for all native modules](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/24875) to guarantee type safe operations in native. In just over two weeks, the community sent ~40 Pull Requests to complete this work for flow typed native modules. Aside from the people already mentioned above, we‚Äôd like to thank [Micha≈Ç Chudziak](https://twitter.com/michalchudziak), [Micha≈Ç Pierzcha≈Ça](https://twitter.com/thymikee), [Wojtek Szafraniec](https://github.com/wojteg1337), and [Jean Regisser](https://github.com/jeanregisser) and everyone else who sent one or more Pull Requests.\n- **Haste:** Since 2015 React Native used the [‚Äúhaste‚Äù module system](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/commit/0629e3e2289ed54fac854472aec9a5f6c8318c98#diff-c42b758729cb89976b3a8fd51d1227fa) that allows importing modules just via a global id instead of a relative path which is convenient but not well supported by many tools. [James Ide](https://twitter.com/JI) proposed removing haste, similar to how React removed haste many years ago. He planned all the work through an [umbrella task](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/24316) and he sent 18 Pull Requests to make it happen! Check out [his Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/JI/status/1136369775083319296) to learn more.\n- **Android Fragments:** [John Shelley](https://github.com/jpshelley)‚Äòs proposal to make React Native work via [Android Fragments](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/12199) was merged and will be available in 0.61. [Read more about Android Fragments here](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments).",

We‚Äôll also make sure to communicate breaking changes and exciting new features by publishing blog posts for each major release. Many of these improvements will make future upgrades beyond the 0.60 release significantly easier.\n- **Support / Uncertainty:** Many people were frustrated with the lack of activity on Pull Requests and general uncertainty about Facebook's investment in React Native. As we've shown above, we can confidently say that we are ready for many more Pull Requests and we are eagerly looking forward to your proposals and contributions!\n- **Performance:** React Native 0.59 shipped with a new and much faster version of JavaScriptCore (JSC). Separately, we have been working on making it easier to enable [inline-requires](/docs/performance#ram-bundles-inline-requires) by default and we have more exciting updates for you in the next couple of months.\n- **Documentation:** We recently started an effort to [overhaul and rewrite all of React Native's documentation](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/issues/929).
