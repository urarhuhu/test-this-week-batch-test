It’s heavily inspired by the design of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and is the product of a collaboration between [Facebook](https://code.facebook.com) and [Expo](https://expo.io) (formerly Exponent).",

With Create React Native App, there’s no need to use Xcode or Android Studio, and you can develop for your iOS device using Linux or Windows. This is accomplished using the Expo app, which loads and runs CRNA projects written in pure JavaScript without compiling any native code.",

The Expo app does include APIs for camera, video, contacts, and more, and bundles popular libraries like [Airbnb’s react-native-maps](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/map-view/), or [Facebook authentication](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/facebook/). However if you need a native code dependency that Expo doesn’t bundle then you’ll probably need to have your own build configuration for it. Just like Create React App, “ejecting” is supported by CRNA.",
