The problem: lots of libraries, hard to test, need to manually apply heuristics and not immediately obvious which ones are just the best ones that you should use. It's also hard to know if something is compatible with CRNA/Expo. So Native Directory tries to solve these problems. Check it out and [add your library](https://github.com/react-community/native-directory) to it. The list of libraries is in [here](https://github.com/react-community/native-directory/blob/master/react-native-libraries.json). This is just our first pass of it, and we want this to be owned and run by the community, not just Expo folks. So please pitch in if you think this is valuable and want to make it better!\n- Added initial support for installing npm packages in [Snack](https://snack.expo.io/) with Expo SDK 19. Let us know if you run into any issues with it, we are still working through some bugs. Along with Native Directory, this should make it easy to test libraries that have only JS dependencies, or dependencies included in [Expo SDK](https://github.com/expo/expo-sdk). Try it out:\n  - [react-native-modal](https://snack.expo.io/ByBCD_2r-)\n  - [react-native-animatable](https://snack.expo.io/SJfJguhrW)\n  - [react-native-calendars](https://snack.expo.io/HkoXUdhr-)\n- [Released Expo SDK19](https://blog.expo.io/expo-sdk-v19-0-0-is-now-available-821a62b58d3d) with a bunch of improvements across the board, and we're now using the [updated Android JSC](https://github.com/SoftwareMansion/jsc-android-buildscripts).\n- Working on a guide in docs with [Alexander Kotliarskyi](https://github.com/frantic) with a list of tips on how to improve the user experience of your app. Please join in and add to the list or help write some of it!\n  - Issue: [#14979](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/14979)\n  - Initial pull request: [#14993](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/14993)\n- Continuing to work on: audio/video, camera, gestures (with Software Mansion, `react-native-gesture-handler`), GL camera integration and hoping to land some of these for the first time in SDK20 (August), and significant improvements to others by then as well. We're just getting started on building infrastructure into the Expo client for background work (geolocation, audio, handling notifications, etc.).\n- [Adam Miskiewicz](https://twitter.com/skevy) has made some nice progress on imitating the transitions from [UINavigationController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinavigationcontroller) in [react-navigation](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation). Check out an earlier version of it in [his tweet](https://twitter.com/skevy/status/884932473070735361) - release coming with it soon. Also check out `MaskedViewIOS` which he [upstreamed](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/8ea6cea39a3db6171dd74838a6eea4631cf42bba).

There are other ways to contribute that do not require writing code, such as by triaging issues or updating the docs.\n  - At the time of writing, React Native has **635** [open issues](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues) and **249** [open pull requests](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pulls). This is overwhelming for our maintainers, and when things get fixed internally, it is difficult to ensure the relevant tasks are updated.\n  - We are unsure what the best approach is to handle this while keeping the community satisfied. Some (but not all!) options include closing stale issues, giving significantly more people permissions to manage issues, and automatically closing issues that do not follow the issue template. We wrote a \"What to Expect from Maintainers\" guide to set expectations and avoid surprises.

I am happy to report that we are living up to the \"zero flakiness policy\" and the tests are passing consistently so far.\n- Detox for Android is moving forward nicely. We are getting significant help from the community. We are expecting an initial version in about two weeks.\n- [DetoxInstruments](https://github.com/wix/detoxinstruments), our performance testing tool, is getting a little bigger than we originally intended.
