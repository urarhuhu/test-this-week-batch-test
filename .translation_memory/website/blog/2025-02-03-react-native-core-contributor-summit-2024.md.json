E.g. it may be necessary to extract platform-native logic for iOS and Android from the shared C++ codebase. Part of which was covered by the LeanCore 2.0 discussion.\n- **Old architecture support** – as expected, the team confirmed that new React 19 features based on concurrent rendering, won’t work in old architecture. New features are primarily targeted for the new architecture. Due to blockers in React 19 release schedule it’s still not clear where to draw the line between functionality supported by both new and old architecture.\n- **3rd party libraries for React Native** – today we library authors can use TurboModules, ExpoModules, recently NitroModules to achieve the same goal of bridging native platform functionality. We need better documentation on how to make it well.\n- **Brownfield docs** – at the time of the summit, the official documentation for integrating React Native into native apps was quite dated. Since then the team has followed through with up-to-date and simpler docs for Android and iOS.\n- **Tree-shaking for Metro web** – core Metro team is open to merge the work from the Expo team in this area.",

While working on the New Architecture for React Native for Windows, the team sees potential in C++ modules allowing for even more code sharing across platforms which will hopefully ease the burden of targeting desktop platforms. It’s worth noting that on the community side Software Mansion is working on adding desktop support for their most popular modules, such as React Native Screens, Gesture Handler and Reanimated.",
